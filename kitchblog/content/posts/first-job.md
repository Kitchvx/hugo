## About the Job

Just over a couple weeks ago I started my first job within the IT Industry. It's giving me great work experince in using the different [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/) tools such as [Elementor](https://elementor.com/), [Slider Revolution](https://www.sliderrevolution.com/) and [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/) I'm currently designing and developing a website for a local shop in my town, once the site has gone through the design, staging, optimisation and testing phases I will link it. Designing the product pages, catagories, using photoshop and utilising slider revolution to display the deals that are currently on I am working on adding the different products that the business sells along with optimising [SEO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization). When the website has passed the testing period it will go live and I will be tasked with maintaining the website to make sure everything goes smoothly, I will be writting documentation on the webiste for people in the future who are hired to maintain the website as the last person to create a website for the shop didn't provide any information or documentation maaking troubleshooting harder than it needed to be.

Web design and development is fun and helps me show my skills however I don't see myself having a career in it but I do see myself potentially doing freelance for small business and individuals that need a website, like my friend who I am currently creating a website for, using hugo. I will also be managing this website for him as he doesn't know how to use the command line or have any tools to do back-end development for a webiste using the hugo framework.

Thank you for reading my small post about my job, didn't have much to say just decided to write about it a little. you can check out my projects [here](/projects/).
